      <description>Awesome Accelerated-MRI-Reconstruction-Papers Hey, I came across awesome git repos listing ml papers on different topics. Here are two examples: https://github.com/xiaomengyc/Few-Shot-Semantic-Segmentation-Papers and https://github.com/hoya012/awesome-anomaly-detection. Other people also find these curated lists awesome since there is a couple of hundreds of forks and thousands of stars. Since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any on Accelerated MRI reconstruction, I took the time and created my own curated list. Enjoy it here: https://github.com/jkkronk/MRI-Reconstruction-Papers
Cheers, Jonatan</description>

      <description>ISMRM 2021 Highlights Hi all!
This post lists my highlights and comments on ISMRM 2021 as an engineer and first-year PhD student in biomedical imaging interested in MR reconstruction. ISRMRM 2021 is an MR imaging conference where researchers from varying backgrounds, physics, medicine, biology and engineering, meet to discuss MRI. My interests are within reconstruction and ml. Hence I mainly attended the sessions linked to these, and my list is for sure biased towards the engineering perspective.</description>
