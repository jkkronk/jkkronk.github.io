      <description>ISMRM 2021 Highlights Hi all!
This post lists my highlights and comments on ISMRM 2021 as an engineer and first-year PhD student in biomedical imaging interested in MR reconstruction. ISRMRM 2021 is an MR imaging conference where researchers from varying backgrounds, physics, medicine, biology and engineering, meet to discuss MRI. My interests are within reconstruction and ml. Hence I mainly attended the sessions linked to these, and my list is for sure biased towards the engineering perspective.</description>
